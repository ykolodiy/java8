cmd /c C:\\wget.exe --user ddddd --password ddddd  --no-clobber --convert-links --random-wait -r -p -E -e robots=off -U mozilla http://teams.inside.pearson.com/sch2/sim

where:
--no-clobber If a file is downloaded more than once in the same directory = no owerwrite
--convert-links After the download is complete, convert the links in the document to make them suitable for local viewing
--random-wait Some websites may perform log analysis to identify retrieval programs
-r, --recursive Turn on recursive retrieving.
-p, --page-requisites this option causes wget to download all the files that are necessary to properly display a given HTML page. 
-m, --mirror	Turn on options suitable for mirroring. This option turns on recursion and time-stamping, sets infinite recursion depth and keeps FTP directory listings. It is currently equivalent to -r -N -l inf -nr.
-E, --html-extension If a file of type application/xhtml+xml or text/html is downloaded and the URL does not end with the regexp "\.[Hh][Tt][Mm][Ll]?", this option will cause the suffix .html to be appended to the local file name
-e command, --execute  Execute command as if it were a part of the file .wgetrc. A command thus invoked will be executed after the commands in .wgetrc, thus taking precedence over them.
-U agent-string, --user-agent=agent-string The HTTP protocol allows the clients to identify themselves using a "User-Agent" header field.
-N, --timestamping Turn on time stamping. Output file will have timestamp matching remote copy; if file already exists locally, and remote file is not newer, no download will occur.
-I list, --include-directories=list	Specify a comma-separated list of directories you want to follow when downloading. Elements of list may contain wildcards.
`-nr'`--dont-remove-listing'
Don't remove the temporary `.listing' files generated by FTP retrievals

if we want to download just 1 folder with no parent
cmd /c C:\\wget.exe --user ddddddd  --password ddddddd wget -m -e robots=off --no-parent http://teams.inside.pearson.com/sch2/sim/instructional/
