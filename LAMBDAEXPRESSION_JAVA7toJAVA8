lambda expression can be assigned to a variable


aMaVariableinJAVA7 = public void perform () {System.out.println("hello");}

no need public cos its belong to function what has that code
no need perform coz variable is the name
no need void java can figure out looking at code
need to put "->" btw () and {}

aMaVariableinJAVA8 =                            () -> {System.out.println("hello");}



if its just 1 line u can remove {}

aMaVariableinJAVA8 =                            () -> System.out.println("hello");
